# Company ABC - Data Quality Management and Staff Dashboard Visualisation

This is a data analysis assessment assigned to me for a job position with a Singapore public agency.

Company ABC has supplied 22 datasets. Each record represents a staff member tapping their access pass at the buildingâ€™s entry system at a specific time.

This Rmd is divided into two parts: the first addresses data quality issues, while the second focuses on dashboard visualisation.

The Rmd output can be viewed in the file "Data-Quality_Staff-Dashboard.md".
