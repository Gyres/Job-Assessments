# Compute Average Monthly Wage by Firm Size

#### Date: 2024-09-18

## Introduction  
**Brief Overview**
This project aims to compute the average monthly wage paid by companies of different sizes using R. The analysis uses two datasets: one containing company information and another containing employee wage data. The R Markdown (RMD) code is structured to read the datasets, classify firms by size, and compute the average monthly wage for each firm size.

This project was undertaken as part of a job application assessment for a data analyst position with a Singapore public agency. It demonstrates data analysis and manipulation skills using R, focusing on calculating company-wise wage statistics.

**Objectives**  
- Compute the average monthly wage based on firm size (small, medium, large).
- Merge two datasets (companies and employees) for analysis.
- Provide a clean and reproducible workflow using R Markdown.
