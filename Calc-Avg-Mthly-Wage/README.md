# Compute Average Monthly Wage

#### Date: 2024-09-18

This is a data analysis assessment assigned to me for a job position with a Singapore public agency.

2 pseudo datasets containing information about some companies and its employees was provided.

The task is to compute the average monthly wage paid by companies of different sizes in a pseudo code.

The Rmd code can be viewed in the file "Calc-Avg-Mthly-Wage.Rmd".
