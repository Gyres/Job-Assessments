This repository contains my submission for a data analysis assessment as part of a job application with a Singapore public agency.

## Task Overview

The assessment includes 8 datasets and 3 data dictionaries related to US states, which are used for analysis.

## Objectives and RMarkdown structure

The analysis is divided into two sections:
- State Categorization: Categorizing US states based on their various characteristics.
- Assault Rate Prediction: Identifying statistically significant factors that can predict assault rates.

## Implementation

The RMarkdown output can be viewed in "States-Grouping_Assault-Prediction.md".
