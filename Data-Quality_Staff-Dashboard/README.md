#### Date: 2024-09-19

This repository contains my submission for a data analysis assessment as part of a job application with a Singapore public agency.

## Task Overview

Analyse the 22 datasets provided by Company ABC, each containing records of staff members tapping their access passes at the buildingâ€™s entry system, with each record capturing the exact time of entry.

## Objectives

The task involved:
- Identifying and resolving data quality issues in the 22 datasets.
- Creating dashboards for end-users.

## RMarkdown Breakdown and Implementation
The RMarkdown file is structured in two main parts:
- Data Quality: Identification and resolution of data quality issues.
- Dashboard Visualisation: Development of dashboards for enhanced data reporting and decision-making.

The RMarkdown output can be viewed in the file "Data-Quality_Staff-Dashboard.md".

The combined dashboard is available on Tableau Public, https://public.tableau.com/views/ABC-Staff-Dashboard/Dashboard
